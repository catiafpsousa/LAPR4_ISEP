RCOMP 2022-2023 Project - Sprint 1 review
=========================================
### Sprint master: 1210849 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #
* T.1.1 - Implement Shared Board Protocol (SBP) to facilitate data exchanges between the Shared Board App
  and the Shared Board Server network applications.
* T.1.2 - Implement five fundamental message codes that must be implemented by every
  application using SBP. Establish additional unique message codes as needed to implement new features.
* T.1.3 - The server should implement the shared boards and receives updates from the clients. As updates are executed in the server,
  the server notifies the clients of these updates. As such, all clients are able to maintain a "realtime"
  clone of the shared boards. The Shared Board App implements a "small" HTTP server that serves a page that displays a board view.

#### Sprint Outputs/Products: ####
* Shared Board Protocol (SBP) implementation
* The five fundamental message codes are expected to be implemented and fully operational in the Shared Board App application (client) and the Shared Board Server application (server).
* All clients are able to maintain a "realtime" clone of the shared boards. The Shared Board App implements a "small" HTTP server that serves a page that displays a board view.


# 2. Subtasks assessment #
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

* Totally implemented with no issues
* Totally implemented with issues
* Partially implemented with no issues
* Partially implemented with issues

For the last three cases, a text description of what has not been implemented and present issues must be added.
Unimplemented features and issues solving is assigned to the same member on the next sprint.
