RCOMP 2022-2023 Project - Sprint 4 planning
===========================================
### Sprint master: 1210849 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #
**T.3.1.**
Implement Shared Board Protocol (SBP) to facilitate data exchanges between the Shared Board App
and the Shared Board Server network applications.

**T.3.2.**
Implement five fundamental message codes that must be implemented by every
application using SBP. Establish additional unique message codes as needed to implement new features.

**T.3.3.**
The server should implement the shared boards and receives updates from the clients. As updates are executed in the server,
the server notifies the clients of these updates. As such, all clients are able to maintain a "realtime"
clone of the shared boards. The Shared Board App implements a "small" HTTP server that serves a page that displays a board view.
