## Aggregates Identification Process ##

An aggregate is a cluster of related objects that are treated as a single unit of consistency and transactionality. 
Aggregates encapsulate the state and behavior of a specific domain concept, and they ensure that all changes to the 
objects within the aggregate are made in a consistent and controlled manner.

Before creating aggregates we first identified the domain concepts that needed to be modeled and defined their relationships.
Then, we started to identify the entities and value objects.
Finally, we defined aggregates based on business rules, transactional boundaries and consistency constraints using entities related to each other. 

### Entities and Value Objects ### 

* Entities are objects that have a distinct identity and are defined by their attributes and behavior. 
They are used to represent objects or concepts in the domain that have a lifecycle, meaning that they exist and evolve over time. 
They are distinguished from other types of objects in the domain, such as value objects or services, 
by the fact that they have a unique identity that persists over time, even if their attributes change.
* Value objects are immutable objects that represent a concept or an idea that has a value or identity.

Next is presented a table with the identified aggregates specifying the aggregate root, entities and value objects associeted:
