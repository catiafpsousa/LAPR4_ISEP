## FUNCTIONALITY

### Auditing
- _Generate **automatic grades and feedbacks** to evaluate the Student performance._
- _Generate **reports** to analyze data from the courses, meetings and classes._
- _**Overview Dashboards** should be automatically created._

###  Authentication
- _All those who wish to use the applications must be **authenticated** with a password._
