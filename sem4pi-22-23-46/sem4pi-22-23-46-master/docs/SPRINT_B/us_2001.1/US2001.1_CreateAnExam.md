### 2.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications


**From the specifications document:**
>"**Automated Exams** The platform should support a fully automated approach for exams and evaluation. Teachers should be able to design exams using a simple and intuitive language and students should be able to take these exams and automatically have
> feedback and resulting grades after submitting them. The platform should also present
> dashboards about exam results both to students and teachers. Figure 2.1 presents an
> illustration of an online exam." (p.3)

>"**FRE01 - Create Exam** A Teacher creates a new exam. This includes the specifcation 
> of the exam (i.e., its structure, in accordance with a grammar for exams that is used to 
> validate the specifcation of the exam)" (p.6)

>"NFR09 - Exam Language The support for exams (its design, feedback and grading)
> must follow specific technical requirements, specified in LPROG. The ANTLR tool should 
> be used (https://www.antlr.org/)" (p.8)

>"**Teachers** can create exams. An exam is related to a specific course. It has a unique title 
> and a small description. Exams have also a open and a close date. The open date is the time 
> when students can start to take the exam. The close date is the deadline for students to submit 
> the exam." (p.14)

>"" (p.13)


**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Poderia esclarecer o que é um Course e o que é uma Class?
>
> **Answer:** Um "course" é um curso. [...]  Num curso de ensino superior, o mais similar a "course" seria uma unidade curricular ou disciplina. 
>             <br> **Uma "class" é uma aula (relativa a um "course").**

> **Question:** Boa tarde nos estamos a ter uma duvida sobre qual e a diferença entre meetings e classes
>
> **Answer:** [...] as aulas são regulares e têm participantes pré-definidos. [...]

> **Question:** Should we allow the users to choose until what date they want to schedule the weekly classes or should the weakly classes be scheduled until the end of the semester and if so what is the duration of the semester ?
>
> **Answer:** **Only teachers should be able to schedule classes.** 
>             <br> I think there is no requirement that refers to the course duration or the concept of term or semester. Therefore, if you do not consider the course to have a pre-established ending date, **then you also should not consider the end of the recurrence (in fact, it will happen when the manager closes the course).**
>             <br>If you consider that a course must have an ending date, then also consider the end of the recurrence of the classes to the same date. 
>             <br><br>However, since "nothing" happens at the time of the classes, the option you take will have limited implications, I think, only at the validation of availability of participants.



### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria ###

* **AC1:** It should be impossible to schedule classes that are coincident with other classes of the same course.
* **AC2:** System must check if the Teacher is available for the class period



### 1.4. Dependencies ###

* There is a dependency to **US1001 - As Manager, I want to be able to register, disable/enable, and list users of the system** since at least one **Teacher** must exist in order to **schedule a class**.
<br>
* _**US1002** - As Manager, I want to create courses_
<br>
* _**US1004** - As Manager, I want to open and close courses_


## 3. Analysis

*In this section, the team should report the study/analysis/comparison that was done in order to take the best design decisions for the requirement. This section should also include supporting diagrams/artifacts (such as domain model; use case diagrams, etc.),*

### 3.1 Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

![US1010 DM Excerpt](./DM_Excerpt_1010.svg)

### 3.2 System Sequence Diagram (SSD)



## 4. Design

*In this sections, the team should present the solution design that was adopted to solve the requirement. This should include, at least, a diagram of the realization of the functionality (e.g., sequence diagram), a class diagram (presenting the classes that support the functionality), the identification and rational behind the applied design patterns and the specification of the main tests used to validade the functionality.*


### 4.1. Realization (Sequence Diagram - SD)


### 4.2. Class Diagram (CD)

![a class diagram](class-diagram-01.svg "A Class Diagram")

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

### 4.4. Tests

**Test 1:** *Verifies that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.*

```java
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
	Example instance = new Example(null, null);
}
```


## 5. Implementation

*In this section the team should present, if necessary, some evidencies that the implementation is according to the design. It should also describe and explain other important artifacts necessary to fully understand the implementation like, for instance, configuration files.*

*It is also a best practice to include a listing (with a brief summary) of the major commits regarding this requirement.*

### **RegisterVaccinationCenterUI:**

```java
private final RegisterVaccinationCenterController vccontroller; 

public RegisterVaccinationCenterUI() {
  vccontroller = new RegisterVaccinationCenterController();
}

public void run() {
  showRegisterVC();
  showSaveVC();
}

private void showRegisterVC() {
  (...)
}

private void showSaveVC() {
  (...)
}
```

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

*In this section the team should describe the efforts realized in order to integrate this functionality with the other parts/components of the system*

*It is also important to explain any scripts or instructions required to execute an demonstrate this functionality*

## 7. Observations

*This section should be used to include any content that does not fit any of the previous sections.*

*The team should present here, for instance, a critical prespective on the developed work including the analysis of alternative solutioons or related works*

*The team should include in this section statements/references regarding third party works that were used in the development this work.*
